			<p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
				We created this product because we found it incredibly time-consuming to aggregate relevant financial information for each company on our watchlist or in our portfolio. Despite spending countless hours researching, we often lacked a clear sense of where a company was heading strategically or financially.
			</p>
			<p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
				With this platform, you can quickly grasp the health of a company at a glance. Our goal is to provide you with a sound, data-driven basis to make confident investment and divestment decisions â€” and keeping a cool head when markets are volatile.
